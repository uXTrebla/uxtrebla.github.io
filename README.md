# uxtrebla.github.io

This repository hosts the source for the uxtrebla.github.io GitHub Pages site. It contains the static assets that are published to the web, including the main HTML entry point and supporting content for the site.

## Contents

- `index.html` – the primary page served by GitHub Pages.
- `README.md` – repository overview and purpose.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to provide a lightweight, static site that can be deployed directly through GitHub Pages. Update the HTML (and add additional assets as needed) to change the public-facing site.
